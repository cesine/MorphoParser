   I used this script to create HMM representations for the dense corpus. It will treat the list of words as a corpus, calculating frequencies accross word boundaries although this innapropriate at this stage of the analysis. 

   On the other hand this software can be used to create an HMM for each word, increasing the number of states until the transitions are deterministic at 1.0 or around 0.9 but this seems like a waste of processing time."
