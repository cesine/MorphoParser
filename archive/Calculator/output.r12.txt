Assignment 1 : Calculator
Description: A calculator demonstrating
	*the use of classes in C++
	*manipulation of pointers
	*algorithm for manipulating arbitrarily large integers in any base system (decimal, binary, hexidecimal etc) 
	*dynamic memory allocation and destruction ===================================================

Creating some largeints.
Creating a Sequence using input:  1123 of size 4
Memory was allocated here is the reference: 0xbffffa08
1 these values should match 1
1 these values should match 1
2 these values should match 2
3 these values should match 3
Size is 4
Size is 4
Creating a largeint
Creating a Sequence using input:  0064 of size 4
this leading zero is being ignored, size is now 3
this leading zero is being ignored, size is now 2
Memory was allocated here is the reference: 0xbffff9ec
6 these values should match 6
4 these values should match 4
Size is 2
Size is 2
Creating a largeint
Creating a Sequence using input:  -2032 of size 5
its a negative number, size is now 4
Memory was allocated here is the reference: 0xbffff9d0
2 these values should match 2
0 these values should match 0
3 these values should match 3
2 these values should match 2
Size is 4
Size is 4
Creating a largeint
Creating a Sequence using input:  27 of size 2
Memory was allocated here is the reference: 0xbffff9b4
2 these values should match 2
7 these values should match 7
Size is 2

Creating a largeint

Overwriting what was in x 1123 with what's in x2 11123
Assigning from an existing sequence to another existing sequence
Deep copying 1 to 1
Deep copying 1 to 1
Deep copying 1 to 1
Deep copying 2 to 2
Deep copying 3 to 3

Testing arithmatical operations.

Checking the size of the accumulator...5
Checking the size of the input...		2

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...11123
Checking the originalstring of the input...		0064
This is the string: 11123
This is the string: 
Adding 
 11123
+
Created an empty Sequence of size 10
Memory was allocated here is the ref0xbffff8fc
Created an empty Sequence of size 10
Memory was allocated here is the ref0xbffff8e4
The accumulator is longer than the input.
Assigning from an existing sequence to another existing sequence
Deep copying 1 to 1
Deep copying 1 to 1
Deep copying 1 to 1
Deep copying 2 to 2
Deep copying 3 to 3
Assigning from an existing sequence to another existing sequence
Deep copying 6 to 6
Deep copying 4 to 4

Created an empty Sequence of size 6
Memory was allocated here is the ref0xbffff8cc
Adding 3 to 4
This is the new value in the 0 place: 7
Adding 2 to 6
This is the new value in the 1 place: 8
This is the string: 
Addition Completed, result:  For some reason it doesnt print.
