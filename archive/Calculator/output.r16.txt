Assignment 1 : Calculator
Description: A calculator demonstrating
	*the use of classes in C++
	*manipulation of pointers
	*algorithm for manipulating arbitrarily large integers in any base system (decimal, binary, hexidecimal etc) 
	*dynamic memory allocation and destruction ===================================================
====+++=====Running Tests======++++=====

Creating some largeints.
Creating a largeint
	 x is 1123 should match:  1123
Creating a largeint
	 y is 0064 should match:  64
Creating a largeint
	 z is -2032 should match: -2032
Creating a largeint
	 w is 27 should match:  27

Testing the copy constructor
	Copying a LargeInt to a new one
Copying a  large int to a new one
	 p is copied from z -2032 should match: -2032
Creating a largeint

Testing the assignment overloading =
	Overwriting what was in x 1123 with what's in x2 11123
Assigning a  large int to a previously initialized large int
	 x is 11123 should match:  11123

Testing arithmatical operations.
Copying a  large int to a new one

Checking the size of the accumulator...5
Checking the size of the input...		2

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...11123
Checking the originalstring of the input...		0064
The accumulator is longer than the input.
Adding 
  11123
+ 64
Created an empty LargeInt of size 6
Adding 3 to 4
This is the new value in the 0 place: 7
Adding 2 to 6
This is the new value in the 1 place: 8
Just copying 1 (should match 1) to place 2
Just copying 1 (should match 1) to place 3
Just copying 1 (should match 1) to place 4
= 011187
This is the result:  011187

Checking the size of the accumulator...6
Checking the size of the input...		2

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...
Checking the originalstring of the input...		27
The accumulator is longer than the input.
Adding 
  011187
+ 27
Created an empty LargeInt of size 7
Adding 7 to 7
In this base system (10) The addition of 7+7 results in a carry, here is the value: 14	(Note: 
	the carries are added to the x rather than to the result, so durring the 
	successive carrying that might be triggered by a 
	few 999 in a row the x changes, but not the resut holder)
Putting the carry into the next higher position to the left in x. [4] 9
	Carried 1 times.
This is the new value in the 0 place: 4
Adding 9 to 2
In this base system (10) The addition of 9+2 results in a carry, here is the value: 11	(Note: 
	the carries are added to the x rather than to the result, so durring the 
	successive carrying that might be triggered by a 
	few 999 in a row the x changes, but not the resut holder)
Putting the carry into the next higher position to the left in x. [3] 2
	Carried 1 times.
This is the new value in the 1 place: 1
Just copying 2 (should match 2) to place 2
Just copying 1 (should match 1) to place 3
Just copying 1 (should match 1) to place 4
Just copying 0 (should match 0) to place 5
= 0011214
This is the result:  0011214
Creating a largeint
Creating a largeint

Checking the size of the accumulator...3
Checking the size of the input...		1

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...999
Checking the originalstring of the input...		3
The accumulator is longer than the input.
Adding 
  999
+ 3
Created an empty LargeInt of size 4
Adding 9 to 3
In this base system (10) The addition of 9+3 results in a carry, here is the value: 12	(Note: 
	the carries are added to the x rather than to the result, so durring the 
	successive carrying that might be triggered by a 
	few 999 in a row the x changes, but not the resut holder)
Need to carry to the next position to the left.
	 Now x looks like this:  909
		 New carry: 10
Need to carry to the next position to the left.
	 Now x looks like this:  009
		 New carry: 1
Putting the carry into the next higher position to the left in result. [0] 0
	Carried 3 times.
This is the new value in the 0 place: 2
Just copying 0 (should match 0) to place 1
Just copying 0 (should match 0) to place 2
= 1002
This is the result:  1002

Checking the size of the accumulator...4
Checking the size of the input...		5

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...9879
Checking the originalstring of the input...		89878
The input is longer than the accumulator.
Adding 
  89878
+ 9879
Created an empty LargeInt of size 6
Adding 8 to 9
In this base system (10) The addition of 8+9 results in a carry, here is the value: 17	(Note: 
	the carries are added to the x rather than to the result, so durring the 
	successive carrying that might be triggered by a 
	few 999 in a row the x changes, but not the resut holder)
Putting the carry into the next higher position to the left in x. [3] 8
	Carried 1 times.
This is the new value in the 0 place: 7
Adding 8 to 7
In this base system (10) The addition of 8+7 results in a carry, here is the value: 15	(Note: 
	the carries are added to the x rather than to the result, so durring the 
	successive carrying that might be triggered by a 
	few 999 in a row the x changes, but not the resut holder)
Putting the carry into the next higher position to the left in x. [2] 9
	Carried 1 times.
This is the new value in the 1 place: 5
Adding 9 to 8
In this base system (10) The addition of 9+8 results in a carry, here is the value: 17	(Note: 
	the carries are added to the x rather than to the result, so durring the 
	successive carrying that might be triggered by a 
	few 999 in a row the x changes, but not the resut holder)
Need to carry to the next position to the left.
	 Now x looks like this:  80988
		 New carry: 9
Putting the carry into the next higher position to the left in x. [0] 9
	Carried 2 times.
This is the new value in the 2 place: 7
Adding 0 to 9
This is the new value in the 3 place: 9
Just copying 9 (should match 9) to place 4
= 099757
This is the result:  099757
