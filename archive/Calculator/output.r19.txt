Assignment 1 : Calculator
Description: A calculator demonstrating
	*the use of classes and objects in C++
	*manipulation of pointers
	*understanding of cstring and ascii table representation of characters
	*algorithm for manipulating arbitrarily large integers in any base system (decimal, binary, hexidecimal etc) 
	*dynamic memory allocation and destruction 
===================================================
-------Sample interaction (as specified in the assignment requirements):--------
Accumulator: +0			Calculator starts with 0 value
Enter input: +2			User inputs an operation (+,-,*,/,%) and an arbitrarily large integer (2)

Accumulator: +2			Calculator performs (0+2)
Enter input: -3			User inputs a value (-3)

Accumulator: -1			Calculator performs (2-3)
Enter input: 			Calculator waits for user input
---------Operations menu:----------
	+<input> Add <input>
	-<input> Subtract <input>
	*<input> Multiplication by <input> 
	/<input> Division by <input>
	%<input> Modulus by <input>
	=<input> Reset to <input>

	n        Negate 
	c        Clear (reset) to zero
	q        Quit
	h        Help

	t        Run tests

	s        Trace Sequence class. Use this to trace how the data structure works (for TA to grade)
	l        Trace LargeInt class. Use this to trace how the arithmetic works (for the TA to grade)
	o        Trace off

====+++=====Running Tests======++++=====

Creating some largeints.
Creating a largeint
	 x is 1123 should match:  1123
Creating a largeint
	 y is 0064 should match:  64
Creating a largeint
	 z is -2032 should match: -2032
Creating a largeint
	 w is 27 should match:  27

Testing the copy constructor
	Copying a LargeInt to a new one
Copying a  large int to a new one
	 p is copied from z -2032 should match: -2032
Creating a largeint

Testing the assignment overloading =
	Overwriting what was in x 1123 with what's in x2 11123
Assigning a  large int to a previously initialized large int
	 x is 11123 should match:  11123

Testing mathematic operations.
Copying a  large int to a new one

Checking the size of the accumulator...5
Checking the size of the input...		2

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...11123
Checking the originalstring of the input...		0064
The accumulator is longer than the input.
Adding 
  11123
+ 64
Making a longer result array in case there is a carry.
Created an empty LargeInt of size 6
Adding 3 to 4
 0 place of result was: 0
 0 place of result is now: 7

= 011187
This is the result:  011187

Checking the size of the accumulator...6
Checking the size of the input...		2

Checking the originalstring of the accumulator...
Checking the originalstring of the input...		27
The accumulator is longer than the input.
Adding 
  011187
+ 27
The longest operand already has enough space to absorb a carry, creating a result of the same size.
Created an empty LargeInt of size 6
Adding 7 to 7
 0 place of result was: 0
 0 place of result is now: 4
 0 place of x was: 7
 0 place of x is now: 4
 1 place of x plus 1 would be: 9
Adding 9 to 2
