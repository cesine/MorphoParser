The Bourne Supremacy | Drama; Adventure; Thriller; Mystery; Action | 2004 | Super spy Jason Bourne returns in this sequel to the 'Bourne Identity.' Bourne and his girlfriend are living in India, hiding from the CIA and authorities. A hit man tries to kill the couple, but succeeds only in murdering Bourne's girlfriend, Marie. This event jolts Bourne out of hiding. He leaves India, unaware of the reason for the attempt on his life. It is later revealed that the hit man was working for a corrupt CIA official, Ward Abbott, and a Russian mobster. This CIA official wanted Bourne dead in order to frame him. If anybody tried to find Bourne, they'd be chasing a ghost. Jason, still suffering from amnesia, eventually discovers he was once a pawn in the CIA. He had been involved in a killing which was outside the knowledge of the CIA authorities. This scheme to use CIA agents for personal gain and murder had been hatched by the corrupt CIA official Abbott, along with help from the Russian gangster. Ultimately, Bourne succeeds in figuring out the frame job. He sets up Abbott with a confession on a tape recorder. Abbott commits suicide, and Bourne slips under the radar once again. In a thrilling car chase set in Russia, Bourne meets up with the hit man who killed his beloved Marie. Although it isn't clear whether the hit man died, Bourne walks away, content that he's gotten some level of justice. Bourne meets up with the daughter of 2 people who he previously killed. These 2 people were eliminated by Bourne, but he thought he was acting on behalf of the CIA. In reality, he was actually acting on orders from the corrupt CIA man Abbott. He apologizes to the girl, and then slips away to set up the possible third movie in this series. | 108 | PG-13 (Parental Guidance) | Matt Damon as Jason Bourne; Brian Cox as Ward Abbott; Marton Csokas as Jarda; Joan Allen as Pamela Landy; Gabriel Mann as Danny Zorn; Franka Potente as Marie; Julia Stiles as Nicky; Karl Urban as Kirill; Tom Gallop as Tom Cronin; Oksana Akinshina as Irena Neski; Tomas Arana as Martin Marshall; John Bedford Lloyd as Teddy; Tim Griffin as John Nevins; Maxim Kovalevski as Ivan; Michelle Monaghan as Kim; Karel Roden as Gretkov; Ethan Sandler as Kurt; Jevgenij Sitochin as Mr. Neski; Sean Smith as Vic; Marina Weis-Burgaslieva as Mrs. Neski; Yevgeni Sitokhin as Mr. Neski; Patrick Crowley as Jack Weller; Jon Collin as Jarhead; Sam Brown as Jarhead; Shane Sinutko as Jarhead; Barnaby Smith as CIA Techie; Dominique Chiout as Waitress; Wanja Mues as Night Clerk; Aleksei Shmarinov as Moscow Taxi Driver; Stephan Wolf-Schönburg as Suspicious Cop; Olov Ludwig as Market Security Guard; Keshav Nadkarni as Mr. Mohan; Violetta Grafin Tarnowska Bronner as Neski Neighbor; Aleksei Medvedev as Young Cop; Aleksander Doobina as 2nd Cop; Alexander Boyev as 2nd Taxi Driver; Claudio Maniscalco as Immigration Officer; Manfred Witt as Doorman; Alexsei Trotsenko as Vodka Police Passenger; Victoria Unikel as Mercedes Driver; Oksana Semenova as Mercedes Passenger; Vitalei Abdulov as Volga Taxi Owner; Dirk Schoedon as Berlin Taxi Driver; Ivan Shvedoff as Moscow Policeman; Denis Burgazliev as Moscow Policeman; Nick Wilder as Delta C.O.; Chris Cooper as Conklin; Toufig Tulsiram as Voices | 2648

The Exorcist | Drama; Horror | 1973 | Inspired by newspaper reports of a 13-year-old Maryland boy whose body was said to have been taken over by demonic forces. After a lengthily prologue that is nearly incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read the book, the first half of the film develops the essential character relationships and establishes the crisis situation. Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair) is the adorable, almost-pubescent daughter of divorcee and well known movie star Christ MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn). But when she prophesies the death of her mother's acquaintance and urinates in the front of a roomful of dinner guests, Christ starts to wonder what has "gotten into" her daughter. More odd behavior, and a wildly shaking bed, lands Regan in the hospital, where she is subjected to a battery of extremely invasive procedures best described medical pornography. A brain lesion is suspected, but the tests prove nothing. When Regan, supposedly under hypnosis, responds to the smug questions of a hospital shrink by grabbing his scrotum, it is recommended that Christ seek the Church's help. She does, pleading with doubt-ridden Jesuit priest Damien Karras (Jason Miller) to perform an exorcism. The film's second half culminates in an intense battle between Karras and Regan's demonic possessor, after the more experienced exorcist on the scene, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) dies in the struggle. | 122 | R (Restricted) | Max Von Sydow as Father Merrin; Linda Blair as Regan MacNeil; Jason Miller as Father Damien Karras; Ellen Burstyn as Chris MacNeil; Jack MacGowran as Burke Dennings; Kitty Winn as Sharon Spencer; Ron Faber as Chuck, Assistant Director; Barton Heyman as Dr. Klein; Lee J.

Pink Floyd The Wall | Drama; Music | 1982 | The Wall tells the complicated and disturbing story of fictional Pink (Bob Geldof), a successful and enigmatic rock star who loses, little by little, contact with reality. The movie retraces the main events in Pink's life, his relationship with his mother, his rigid school days, all events punctuated with Pink Floyd's music naturally. Pink's success shows some parallel to the rise of fascism and just as Pink loses control over his public persona, he himself, through drug abuse, loses control of his mind, until he finds himself surrounded by a wall, the wall of his success and isolation. His inner search through his past illustrates his frustrating and violent quest to breaking the wall. | 99 | NR (Not Rated) | Bob Geldof as Pink; Eleanor David as Pink's Wife; James Laurenson as Pink's Father; Christine Hargreaves as Pink's Mother; Kevin McKeon as Young Pink; David Bingham as Little Pink; Bob Hoskins as Rock and Roll Manager; Jenny Wright as American Groupie; Alex McAvoy as Teacher; Ellis Dale as English Doctor; James Hazeldine as Lover; Ray Mort as Playground Father; Margery Mason as Teacher's Wife; Robert Bridges as American Doctor; Michael Ensign as Hotel Manager; Marie Passarelli as Spanish Maid; Winston Rose as Security Guard; Joanne Whalley as Groupie; Nell Campbell as Groupie; Emma Longfellow as Groupie; Lorna Barton as Groupie; Rod Bedall as Roadie; Peter Jonfield as Roadie; Philip Davis as Roadie; Gary Olsen as Roadie; Eddie Tagoe as Minder; Dennis Fletcher as Minder; Jonathan Scott as Registrat; Joanna Dickens as Dancing Teacher; John Scott Martin as Dancing Teacher; Marilyn Thomas as Teacher; Brenda Cowling as Teacher; Michael Burrell as Teacher; Malcolm Rogers as Teacher; John Broughton as Teacher; Jon Paul Morgan as Housekeeper; Albert Moses as Janitor; Vincent Wong as Paramedic; Mark Newman as Paramedic; Lucita Lijertwood as Smash & Grab Lady; Betty Whelan as Smash & Grab Lady; David Fleeshman as Man on Station; Joanna Andrews as Wedding Witness; Diana King as Wedding Witness; Roger Kemp as Wedding Witness; David Smythe as Pink's Friend; Keith Wray as Pink's Friend; Alan Bowyer; Debbie King as Little Girl; Roger Waters as Pink's Best Man,; Alan Marshall; Alan Parker; Pink Floyd | 26109

Robin Hood: Men in Tights | Comedy | 1993 | 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' is a farcical tale about Robin Hood (Cary Elwes) on his journey back from the Crusades to England to find Sherlock Forest amiss. King Richard (Patrick Stewart) is still fighting in the Crusades while his evil brother, Prince John (Richard Lewis), and the occasionally dyslexic Sheriff of Rottingham (Roger Rees) are swindling money out of the poor and wreaking havoc on the town. Robin Hood vows to dethrone Prince John with the help of his friends, Ahchoo (Dave Chappelle), Little John (Eric Allan Kramer), Blinkin (Mark Blankfield) and Will Scarlet O'Hara (Matthew Porretta). On his quest, he also meets the fair Maid Marian (Amy Yasbeck) and steals her heart, but the Sheriff will stop at nothing to make her his wife. The scenes are tied together using rapping merry men and long-running jokes, which make the film all the more hilarious.

Spy Game | Thriller; Action | 2001 | Just before the US president is about to visit China, a CIA agent Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt) is captured by the Chinese and is charged with espionage. He would be shot dead unless there is sufficient diplomatic pressure from the US. The price the US may have to pay in the form of bilateral relationship and trade would be very high. So high that CIA top brass decides to disown Tom. Nathan Muir (Robert Redford) is the person who had trained Bishop for the CIA and turned him into a good spy. Nathan learns about the incident on the day of his retirement. He recalls the time he spent with Bishop and decides to try his best to get him out of the situation. He tries to mount a lot of psychological pressure on the CIA, but will he succeed? | 126 | R (Restricted) | Brad Pitt as Tom Bishop/Terry; Robert Redford as Nathan D.

Star Wars Trilogy: A New Hope / The Empire Strikes Back / Return Of The Jedi | Adventure; Science Fiction; Fantasy; Action | 1977 | Was George Lucas's <I>Star Wars Trilogy</I>, the most anticipated DVD release ever, worth the wait? You bet. It's a must-have for any home theater, looking great, sounding great, and supplemented by generous bonus features. <p> <B>The Movies</B><br> <table align=left cellpadding='5' <tr> <td> </td></tr></table> The <I>Star Wars Trilogy</I> had the rare distinction of becoming a cultural phenomenon, a defining event for its generation. On its surface, George Lucas's story is a rollicking and humorous space fantasy that owes debts to more influences than one can count on two hands, but filmgoers became entranced by its basic struggle of good vs. evil 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away,' its dazzling special effects, and a mythology of Jedi knights, the Force, and droids. Over the course of three films--<I>A New Hope</I> (1977), <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I> (1980), and <I>Return of the Jedi</I> (1983)--Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and the roguish Han Solo (Harrison Ford) join the Rebel alliance in a galactic war against the Empire, the menacing Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), and eventually the all-powerful Emperor (Ian McDiarmid). <I>Empire</I> is generally considered the best of the films and <I>Jedi</I> the most uneven, but all three are vastly superior to the more technologically impressive prequels that followed, <I>Episode I, The Phantom Menace</I> (1999) and <I>Episode II, Attack of the Clones</I> (2002). <p> <B>How Are the Picture and Sound?</B><br> <table border=0 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=3 width=155 align='right'> <tr> <td><hr noshade size=1> <font face='Arial,Helvetica' color='336600'> <b>Thanks to a new digital transfer, you've never seen C-3PO glow so golden, and Darth Vader's helmet is as black as the Dark Side.</b> <br> </font> <hr noshade size=1></td> </tr> </table> In a word, spectacular. Thanks to a new digital transfer, you've never seen C-3PO glow so golden, and Darth Vader's helmet is as black as the Dark Side. And at the climactic scene of <I>A New Hope</I>, see if the Dolby 5.1 EX sound doesn't knock you back in your chair. Other audio options are Dolby 2.0 Surround in English, Spanish, and French. (Sorry, DTS fans, but previous <I>Star Wars</I> DVDs didn't have DTS either.) There have been a few quibbles with the audio on <I>A New Hope</I>, however. A few seconds of Peter Cushing's dialogue ('Then name the system!') are distorted, and the music (but not the sound effects) is reversed in the rear channels. For example, in the final scene, the brass is in the front right channel but the back left channel (from the viewer's perspective), and the strings are in the left front and back right. The result feels like the instruments are crossing through the viewer.<p> <B>What's Been Changed?</B><br> The rumors are true: Lucas made <I>more</I> changes to the films for their DVD debut. Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has been added to a scene in <I>Jedi</I>, Ian McDiarmid (the Emperor) replaces Clive Revill with slightly revised lines in <I>Empire</I>, Temuera Morrison has rerecorded Boba Fett's minimal dialogue, and some other small details have been altered. Yes, these changes mean that the <I>Star Wars</I> films are no longer the ones you saw 20 years ago, but these brief changes hardly affect the films, and they do make sense in the overall continuity of the two trilogies. It's not like a digitized Ewan McGregor has replaced Alec Guiness's scenes, and the infamous changes made for the 1997 special-edition versions were much more intrusive (of course, those are in the DVD versions as well).<p> <B>How Are the Bonus Features?</B><br> <table align=left cellpadding='5' <tr> <td> </td></tr></table> Toplining is <I>Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy</I>, a 150-minute documentary incorporating not only the usual making-of nuts and bolts but also the political workings of the movie studios and the difficulties Lucas had getting his vision to the screen (for example, after resigning from the Directors' Guild, he lost his first choice for director of <I>Jedi</I>: Steven Spielberg). It's a little adulatory, but it has plenty to interest any fan. The three substantial featurettes are 'The Characters of <I>Star Wars</I>' (19 min.), which discusses the development of the characters we all know and love, 'The Birth of the Lightsaber' (15 min.), about the creation and evolution of a Jedi's ultimate weapon, and 'The Force Is with Them: The Legacy of <I>Star Wars</I>' (15 min.), in which filmmakers such as Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron talk about how they and the industry were affected by the films and Lucas's technological developments in visual effects, sound, and computer animation.<p> The bonus features are excellent and along the same lines as those created for <I>The Phantom Menace</I> and <I>Attack of the Clones</I>. Each film has a commentary track, recorded by Lucas, Ben Burtt (sound design), Dennis Muren (visual effects), and Carrie Fisher, with Irvin Kershner joining in on the film he directed, <I>The Empire Strikes Back</I>. Recorded separately and skillfully edited together (with supertitles to identify who is speaking), the tracks lack the energy of group commentaries, but they're enjoyable and informative, with a nice mix of overall vision (Lucas), technical details (Burtt, Muren, Kershner), and actor's perspective (Fisher). Interestingly, they discuss some of the 1997 changes (Mos Eisley creatures, the new Jabba the Hutt scene) but not those made for the DVDs.<p> There's also a sampler of the Xbox game <I>Star Wars: Battlefront</I>, which lets the player reenact classic film scenarios (blast Ewoks in the battle of Endor!); trailers and TV spots from the films' many releases; and a nine-minute preview of the last film in the series, <I>Episode III, Revenge of the Sith</I> (here identified by an earlier working title, <I>The Return of Darth Vader</I>). Small extra touches include anamorphic widescreen motion menus with dialogue, original poster artwork on the discs, and a whopping 50 chapter stops for each film.<p> <B>'The Force Is Strong with This One'</B><br> The <I>Star Wars Trilogy</I> is an outstanding DVD set that lives up to the anticipation. There will always be resentment that the original versions of the films are not available as well, but George Lucas maintains that these are the versions he always wanted to make. If fans are able to put this debate aside, they can enjoy the adventures of Luke, Leia, and Han for years to come. <I>--David Horiuchi</I> | 615 | PG (Parental Guidance) | Alec Guinness as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi; Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker; Anthony Daniels as C-3PO; Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa; Harrison Ford as Han Solo; Peter Cushing as Grand Moff Tarkin; Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian; Kenny Baker as R2-D2; Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca; David Prowse as Darth Vader; Frank Oz as Yoda; James Earl Jones as Voice of Darth Vader; Jeremy Bulloch as Boba Fett; Kenneth Colley as Captain/Admiral Piett; Phil Brown as Uncle Owen; Shelagh Fraser as Aunt Beru | 22331

Stigmata | Drama; Horror; Fantasy; Thriller; Mystery | 1999 | The Vatican relies on Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) to investigate, and usually debunk, claims of miraclesas the movie opens, he is investigating statues in Brazil crying tears of blood. He exposes the statues as a fraud. He is sent to the U. S. where he meets Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), a young, atheist, pretty, and independent hairdresser who is exhibiting stigmatathe five wounds suffered by Christ when he was crucified. Father Kiernan works with Frankie to uncover the mysteryis she crazy? Possessed? The key is a crucifix that belonged to a now-dead priest who was translating a lost, and perhaps forbidden, gospel. The crucifix, given to Frankie by her mother, is perhaps the source of Frankie's wounds, and other unexplained phenomena surrounding her. | 103 | R (Restricted) | Patricia Arquette as Frankie Paige; Gabriel Byrne as Father Andrew Kiernan; Nia Long as Donna Chadway; Jonathan Pryce as Cardinal Daniel Houseman; Enrico Colantoni as Father Dario; Ann Cusack as Dr. Reston; Portia De Rossi as Jennifer Kelliho; Tom Fahn as MTA Man; Lydia Hazan as Attending Nurse; Tom Hodges as ER Nurse; Thomas Kopache as Father Durning; Dick Latessa as Father Gianni Delmonico; Duke Moosekian as Dr. Eckworth; Patrick Muldoon as Steven; Mariah Nunn as Sister Angela; Kessia Randall as Cheryl; Rade Serbedzija as Marion Petrocelli; Frankie Thorn as Donna's Customer; Shaun Toub as Doctor; Valarie Trapp as Woman with a Baby; Shaun Duke as Dr. Eckworth; Mariah Pitzer as Homeless Woman; Jack Donner as Father Alameida; Richard Conti as Valet Priest; Mary Linda Phillips as Sister Agnes; Liz Cruz as Waitress; Faith Christopher as Waitress; Joe Ruffo as Guard; Federico Scutti as Guard; William Howell as Aerialist; Kristopher Davis as Aerialist; Devin Unruh as Flower Boy; Vera Yell as Jennifer's Costumer; Mary Marshall as Nun; Daniel Escalzo as Italian Businessman; Michael P.
