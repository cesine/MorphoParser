		The disappearance of York University chef Claudia Lawrence is now being treated as suspected murder, North Yorkshire Police said. However detectives said they had not found any proof that the 35-year-old, who went missing on 18 March, was dead. Her father Peter Lawrence made a direct appeal to his daughter to contact him five weeks after she disappeared. His plea came at a news conference held shortly after a £10,000 reward was offered to help find Miss Lawrence. Crimestoppers said the sum they were offering was "significantly higher" than usual because of public interest in the case.
		Claudia Lawrence is 35 years old.

Something had caught his eye in the undergrowth - her blue school coat or the deep red of the gloves that she had been wearing - and he stepped off the forestry track. Muriel Drinkwater was lying on her back, one arm outstretched by her side, the other slightly raised but with the gloved hand limp. Her eyes were open, but there was no doubt that she was dead. She was just a few weeks short of her 13th birthday. The constable blew sharply on his whistle. The year was 1946, when murder was supposedly less commonplace than now. The killing of Muriel Drinkwater was to make headlines for months and would vex Detective Chief Inspector William "Bulldog" Chapman, the Scotland Yard detective who led the inquiry, until his death nine years later.

The airline blamed the weakening global economy for the decision, an embarrassing U-turn only eight months after its A380 services were launched with the New York route. Emirates' failure to make New York work with the A380 has raised concerns about the large number of the double-decker aircraft ordered by the carrier.

The fowl are technically illegal under New Haven's zoning code, which prohibited raising hens and other livestock when it was updated during the 1950s. But these days, many dozens of backyard hens are generally tolerated under the city's informal enforcement program — call it "don't cluck, don't tell" — that mostly looks the other way. With urban fowl increasingly common, Alderman Roland Lemar has introduced legislation that would allow residents to raise up to six hens.

Once its fins have been cut off, the shark is often returned to the sea where it suffocates over many painful hours.

The Bronx Zoo, the only zoo left in the city that keeps elephants, said yesterday that it planned to shut down its exhibit after the death of two of its three elephants, or even one. The current generation of children need not despair: The zoo's three elephants — Patty, Maxine and Happy — are in their mid-30's and could live for decades more. But if one elephant dies, the remaining two may not get along. And if two die, officials say it would be inhumane to sustain an exhibit with a single elephant.

		WINNENDEN, Germany ―A teenage gunman killed 15 people, most of them female, on Wednesday in a rampage that began at a school near Stuttgart in southern Germany and ended in a nearby town, where he then killed himself after the police wounded him. The attack left Germany, which tightened tough gun controls after a similar attack at a school seven years ago, struggling to understand the carnage that had again befallen it, a country with relatively little violent crime. In 2002, a gunman killed 16 people before killing himself at a school in Erfurt, in eastern Germany.

		ISSUE 172, March 5, 2009: The world has lost Manx in the Isle of Man, Ubykh in Turkey and last year Alaska's last native speaker of Eyak, Marie Smith Jones, died, taking the Aboriginal language with her. Of the 6,900 languages spoken in the world, some 2,500 are endangered, the UN's cultural agency UNESCO said this week as it released its latest atlas of world languages. That represents a multi-fold increase from the last atlas compiled in 2001 which listed 900 languages threatened with extinction. But experts say this is more the result of better research tools than of an increasingly dire situation for the world's many tongues.
		2,500 languages are in danger of extinction.

A cluster of awaiting vehicles went honking across for a few minutes, then traffic returned to the sparse levels more typical of the pre-dawn period. The September 18 opening was well ahead of the scheduled December 24 goal, earning the contractor, Flatiron-Manson, up to $19.6 million in performance bonuses.

Tata paid investors 608 pence a share, whereas the Brazilians final offer in an auction by the U.K.'s Takeover Panel was 603 pence. The deal triples Tata Steel's capacity to almost 28 million tons a year. Tata: "This is the first step in showing that Indian industry can step outside its shores into an international market place as a global player." Corus, which was created from the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens, currently employs 47,300 people worldwide. Last year the company was the ninth-largest steel maker worldwide.

		Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, has vowed to step down from his position if things "get out of control" in Tibet, where violent demonstrations against China have killed anywhere from 13 to 100 people. At a news conference in Dharamsala, India, the Dalai Lama said he was opposed to the use of violence against China's rule. "Violence is almost suicide," he said. "Even if 1,000 Tibetans sacrifice their lives, it will not help." However, he acknowledges that many radical Tibetans have criticized his policy of non-violence, and says that his only option is to "completely resign" if the bloodshed continues.
		The 14th Dalai Lama was born in Dharamsala.

It was based on interviews of more than 135,000 people. Nationwide, the rate of underaged drinking remained basically unchanged, but in California, it rose from 15.28 percent of California children between 12 and 17-years-old who said they had consumed alcohol in the previous month in 2002, to 16.81 percent who said they had in 2004. Binge drinking, defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least one day in the past 30 days, was reported by 10.27 percent of kids in 2004, up from the 9.16 percent who said they binged in 2002.
